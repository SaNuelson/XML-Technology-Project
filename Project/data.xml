            <description>
				In an intergalactic era, you would think the humanity has finally
				found it's inner peace so to speak. However, there are new dangers
				that await the ever-expanding human race. Extraterrestrial immigrants,
				LGBTS rallies (S stands for Space-kin), and inter-space liberals that
				aim to stomp and destroy all Traditional Values and establich oligarchic
				anarchy upon the galaxy.
				Soon, because of these monstrous intentions, 1st Galactic War took place
				and what used to be a prosperous galactic central, is now but a void
				filled with ashes and scraps of the old world.
				You, as one of the few survivors need to rebuild the civilisation to its
				former glory.
				Embark on your ship into the hostile waste-space, collect resources,
				improve your vessel and root out the bandits that lurk on every corner.
				The Galaxy is counting on you!

				Have you ever wondered how would a revolver look with incendiary ammo?
				Maybe an acid flamethrower, or a grenade minigun?
				Now's your chance! In this new world driven by gun tinkering and
				prime military engineering, you can create all the weirdest and most
				amazing guns you could ever think of.
				Start your journey in this new, comically hostile world, fight monsters
				and collect mods, and then stick them to your Mastergun. Make the things
				go BOOM!, SPLASH!, RATATATA! or BZZZ! all at the same time in this
				rogue-like gun massacre sandbox.
				Caution: The developers are NOT responsible for any injuries caused by
				excessive experimentation with guns. We strongly advise you to use only
				gun modifications approved by the FUDGE (Fictional Union of Dedicated
				Gun Enthusiasts), which you can find in the User Guide

						Stuck then together, pressed the shot button.
						My GPU got fried and my house caught on fire.
						I'm currently at my friend's house, gonna try that again.

				In the beginning you created the heavens and the earth. 
				Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, 
				and the frown of yours was hovering over the waters.
				
				"Nah, that's boring", you said and moved on to some more fun stuff.
				You made simple life and gave it a purpose: To wiggle around in your little sandbox
				for you to do more fun stuff.
				
				Now you're in charge of the world. You're task is simple. Create the human-kind...
				or whatever strikes your fancy. As long as they will worship you, I think nothing's off
				the table. Combine organisms, alter their DNA, watch them grow and evolve. Make them weak,
				make them agile, make them anything you want. Create your own world with your rules according
				to your ideas. And don't forget to write a book about it. I'm sure your creations
				will love reading about how you've created them from scratch, and how much fun you had 
				while doing it. The world is your oyster.
				
				You ARE the mad scientist locked up in his basement after all.

						I strongly dislike how everything turns to disaster no matter what I do.
						I made my world, created some intelligent race. Later that day I start the game,
						see they are killing other fluffy creatures with sticks. So I showed some they can eat
						plants. They started growing their own plants and used them to lure more fluffy
						creatures to their homes to kill them when they wanted.
						
						I give them sticks, they stab each other.
						I give them healing herbs, they poison each other.
						I give them fire, they burn each other. And make better iron sticks to stab each other.
						I give them electricity, they make factories for robots that use sticks to stab each other.
						Last time I gave them rocket science and now they use rockets to travel into my other
						saved games and stab creatures there. I think I saw one of those stick-stabbers in my 
						browser the other day. I'm no longer safe. Moving to Siberia.
						
						Adios.

								I have a different problem. I was starting a new world with some basic
								monad organism. Mom called for dinner so I let it run and went to eat.
								When I came back about an hour later, my world was a chaos, all my creatures
								were running around carrying banners saying: "God is dead".
								Turns out my savegames got mixed up and the monad came into their game.
								They called it the "Spanish flu" or something...

                Oh, the alchemy. How alluring would it be to throw a lizard's tail and two troll eyes into the
                pot, only to pull out a full health potion that gives you fire breath.
                Too bad that's just a game fantasy and you can't achieve that in reality... except..
                Welcome to the Alcheland, the perfect alternative reality for alchemy lovers.
                We've got potions, we've got trolls with many useful body parts! We've even got weird
                plants that try to eat you when you're out there to collect some samples.

                Set up your own alchemy shop in one of the small towns, explore the wilderness, collect
                ingredients, then combine them in your own brass kettle. Expand your knowledge, try out the
                ingredients (preferably on others, not yourself), inspect the side effects, learn how to bypass
                them. Need some muscle? Cave spider broth! Now you're blind? Some tea from carnivorous plant
                should do the trick! Your left hand grew 2 more fingers? Butcher's down the street, have a great day!

				Have you ever wondered what the far future holds?
				If people will travel through space, create settlements on remote planets, stations that float through the eternal void?
				In this game, you take the place of a dreamer in year 2406. The humankind has just started to colonize new worlds and create settlements.
				And you, as a pioneer of the human kin, go on an adventure hoping to create one such colony yourself.
				You end up on a remote asteroid rich in resources that could get you started.
				Communicate with the Earth. Build the settlement. Expand and conquer the asteroid.
				Mine and trade with both human race and extraterrestrial races you meet on your endeavor.
				Create trade routes, fight off the despicable raiders trying to take everything from you.
				Preserve, adapt, overcome!

				I, mage in action.
				Yes, you are the mage. And you've got a magic at your disposal.
				However, the magic bears no form or shape. That's for you to decide.
				Each spell has to be drawn into the air. Each spell acts differently.
				Each spell has intricate details that drastically change it.
				As you draw a spike before you, a fireball appears that fires to distance.
				As you draw a spike with little spiral at the end, another fireball appears, but instead circles around you, as if it's a shield of some sort.
				Each line has its consequence. Each changes the spell. You're options are endless.
				Now go, draw and survive. Your only limit is your IMAGeINAcTION.

						After all these years, Darksiders II remain as one of my favorite games 
						ever, and the very best in the franchise. The company basically went 
						bankrupt to make this game, and with good reason. Darksiders II has 
						aged beautifully, with combat and narrative still satisfying with lore 
						that rivals many other religion based games such as God of War and Diablo. 
						It has always been an absolute pleasure to play this game.
